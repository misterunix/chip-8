A CHIP-8 Interpreter in Go


To start I have included the two documents I will reference to most.

I plan to use [Ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org/) as my graphics engine. 

This is my second attempt to create a chip-8 interpreter. The first worked all they way up until the keyboard routines. Since I was using a console gui, I couldn't get key timing down so it is dead or maybe on life support. Besides, this will give me sound easier.

Since I want this to be easy to understand, I am not going write optimized code but code that is easy to read and understand.
